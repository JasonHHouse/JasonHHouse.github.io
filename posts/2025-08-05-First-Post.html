      <h2>Giving Difficult Feedback</h2>

      <h3>Situation</h3>
      <p>While at Indeed, I was coaching two engineering managers toward promotion to senior manager. Both were
        performing at a high level and demonstrating the ownership and leadership behaviors we needed. Unfortunately,
        due to budget constraints, I could only move forward with one promotion. This meant I had to give difficult
        feedback to a strong performer
        who had done everything right, but wouldn't be promoted, through no fault of their own.</p>
        
      <h3>Task</h3>
      <p>My goal was to deliver this feedback in a way that preserved trust, motivation, and engagement. I needed to be
        honest and empathetic, while also keeping this manager aligned with long-term growth and making sure he felt
        recognized and supported.</p>

      <h3>Action</h3>
      <p>Before the promotion cycle, I had already flagged the budget risks with both managers to manage expectations. I
        also helped them shape strong business cases, spending time coaching on how to frame their impact and growth.
        When the final decision came back, only one case was approved, with the other being rejected due to being “not
        business critical.” I scheduled a 1:1 with the impacted manager and delivered the news with empathy and clarity.
        I made it clear the decision was budgetary, not performance-based, and reaffirmed his value to the team. I
        shared a concrete plan to revisit the case in six months and highlighted how we could strengthen it with
        additional business impact. To acknowledge his contributions, I also secured additional compensation for him,
        which helped soften the outcome. I offered him time to process, including taking the rest of the day off if
        needed.</p>

      <h3>Result</h3>
      <p>He responded with professionalism and genuine support for his colleague who was promoted. He appreciated my
        transparency and the fact that I had gone the extra mile to advocate for him. His motivation remained high, and
        he continued to take on broader responsibilities.</p>

      <h3>Learning</h3>
      <p>This experience reinforced how important it is to lead with transparency, empathy, and foresight. I learned
        that setting expectations early, delivering difficult feedback with care, and recognizing people in multiple
        ways, whether through compensation or future opportunities, can help maintain morale and trust. It also reminded
        me that difficult conversations, when done well, can actually strengthen a team and individual commitment.</p>
