      <h1>The Tightrope Walk: Delivering Difficult News While Nurturing Talent</h1>

      <!--<img src="../images/feedback.jpg" alt="Giving Difficult Feedback" /> -->

      <p>In a previous role, I found myself in a challenging position coaching two talented engineering managers, whom
        I'll refer
        to as Alex and Ben, towards promotion to Director. Both individuals were exemplary leaders. They demonstrated
        initiative
        beyond their current scope, mentored teams effectively with ownership and empathy, and consistently showed the
        high
        performance standards we aimed for within our engineering department. They were strong candidates.</p>

      <p>As we approached promotion season, I focused on documenting their achievements and ensuring they understood the
        path
        ahead. The biggest issue was that a significant budget constraint loomed large for that fiscal year. There
        wasn't room
        in the allocation to fund two promotions simultaneously. This meant I had to deliver disappointing news to one
        of them.
        I reviewed both cases very carefully and decided that Ben was more likely to make it through the difficult
        promotion
        process. Although neither of them was a lock to get a promotion, I wanted to make sure Alex was ready to handle
        any
        decision, even though he hadn't missed a beat in his performance or leadership contributions.</p>

      <p>I knew transparency and empathy were crucial here, not just fairness. Missing out on a promotion because of
        budget, not
        skills, is always hard to hear. Before the final promotion cycle decisions were even made, I had been
        proactively
        syncing with both managers individually. I discussed the potential budget impact openly and honestly, managing
        their
        expectations right from the start about the possibility of having to prioritize due to financial realities
        outside their
        direct control. Furthermore, I invested time in coaching Ben and Alex on how to build a compelling business case
        for
        their promotions. They were technically ready, but needed help framing their contributions and proposed impact
        in terms
        that would resonate with senior leadership, focusing on ROI and strategic alignment. We worked together to
        refine this,
        ensuring it clearly articulated the value each of them was already providing.</p>

      <p>When the final list came back from leadership, unfortunately, Alex's carefully crafted case, despite its
        strength,
        didn't meet the budgetary approval threshold. Ben’s case had been greenlit. I felt the weight of delivering this
        news
        directly to Alex, knowing how capable and dedicated he was. I scheduled a private one-on-one meeting, and I
        approached
        it with care. My opening words were direct but gentle: "Alex, thanks for taking the time to discuss your
        promotion
        readiness. Following our conversation about potential budget constraints, there's been a final decision on the
        Director
        role." I then clearly explained that the rejection was due to overall budget limitations impacting this specific
        year,
        not because of Alex’s performance, skills, or lack of impact. I immediately followed up by reaffirming his
        immense
        value, "Your work here has been critical. You've consistently delivered exceptional results and shown strong
        leadership
        on our team. Your promotion wasn't denied based on anything other than these external financial factors." This
        was
        essential to ensure he understood the decision's basis.</p>

      <p>Alex was disappointed but also understood the situation and was gracious in his response. He was appreciative
        of all the
        time I had spent with him and understood that we had tried our best this round, and we would try again in the
        next
        promotion cycle. To acknowledge his contributions meaningfully, I went beyond just explaining the 'why'. I
        secured an
        alternative form of recognition, a greater than average raise for that year, compensating him monetarily even
        though it
        wasn't a formal promotion. Additionally, I laid out a concrete plan to revisit the promotion case in six months,
        contingent on demonstrating further impact and aligning more closely with specific budget goals at that time.
        Lastly, I
        offered him space to process: "This is news that needs some reflection. Take today if you need to think it
        through." He
        needed time to absorb it all and took the rest of the day off.</p>

      <p>The result was profoundly positive. Alex reacted with remarkable professionalism, immediately extending his
        heartfelt
        congratulations to Ben for the promotion and expressing full understanding of why he hadn't been selected due to
        budgetary reasons. He appreciated my upfront communication about the financial context and felt genuinely
        supported by
        having advocated for him internally, even if success wasn't possible this cycle. He also mentioned that the
        higher raise
        helped ease the blow of losing out on the promotion. Crucially, despite the setback, Alex's motivation remained
        intact.
        He didn't retreat. Instead, he stayed engaged and proactive. I noticed his willingness to step into temporary
        leadership
        gaps in projects previously managed solely by Ben or take on additional cross-functional responsibilities that
        yearned
        for more visibility.</p>

      <p>This experience was a powerful lesson. It solidified my approach to talent management, that anticipating
        constraints
        isn't just about preparation. It's about leading with transparency, even when delivering uncomfortable truths.
        Early
        expectation setting and coaching significantly mitigated potential damage. Recognizing high performers not only
        monetarily but also by investing in their future prospects, via monthly career coaching sessions, is vital for
        maintaining morale and trust. Delivering difficult feedback effectively doesn't break a person. It can
        strengthen
        commitment if handled with empathy, clarity, and a forward-looking perspective.</p>
