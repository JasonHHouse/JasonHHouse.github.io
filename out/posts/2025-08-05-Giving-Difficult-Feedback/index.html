Both individuals were exemplary leaders. They demonstrated initiative beyond their current scope, mentored teams effectively with ownership and empathy, and consistently showed the high performance standards we aimed for within our engineering department. They were strong candidates.</p><p>As we approached promotion season, I focused on documenting their achievements and ensuring they understood the path ahead. The biggest issue was that a significant budget constraint loomed large for that fiscal year. There wasn&#x27;t room in the allocation to fund two promotions simultaneously. This meant I had to deliver disappointing news to one of them. I reviewed both cases very carefully and decided that Ben was more likely to make it through the difficult promotion process. Although neither of them was a lock to get a promotion, I wanted to make sure Alex was ready to handle any decision, even though he hadn&#x27;t missed a beat in his performance or leadership contributions.</p><br/><div class="__2025-08-05-Giving-Difficult-Feedback_flipCard__VkUXk __2025-08-05-Giving-Difficult-Feedback_centered__rdB4H __2025-08-05-Giving-Difficult-Feedback_pointerCursor__nPG5p"><div class="__2025-08-05-Giving-Difficult-Feedback_flipCardInner__BWG41"><div class="__2025-08-05-Giving-Difficult-Feedback_flipCardFront__NvbTT"><img src="/img/fork-in-road.jpg" alt="Fork in the road" width="auto" height="200px" class="__2025-08-05-Giving-Difficult-Feedback_roundedCorners__6ZK_g"/></div><div class="__2025-08-05-Giving-Difficult-Feedback_flipCardBack__npVVq __2025-08-05-Giving-Difficult-Feedback_centeredText__TGD3L __2025-08-05-Giving-Difficult-Feedback_roundedCorners__6ZK_g"><p>Leaders are presented with choices all the time and it is our responsibility to be open and honest in approaching those decisions.</p></div></div></div><br/><p>I knew transparency and empathy were crucial here, not just fairness. Missing out on a promotion because of budget, not skills, is always hard to hear. Before the final promotion cycle decisions were even made, I had been proactively syncing with both managers individually. I discussed the potential budget impact openly and honestly, managing their expectations right from the start about the possibility of having to prioritize due to financial realities outside their direct control. Furthermore, I invested time in coaching Ben and Alex on how to build a compelling business case for their promotions. They were technically ready, but needed help framing their contributions and proposed impact in terms that would resonate with senior leadership, focusing on ROI and strategic alignment. We worked together to refine this, ensuring it clearly articulated the value each of them was already providing.</p><p>When the final list came back from leadership, unfortunately, Alex&#x27;s carefully crafted case, despite its strength, didn&#x27;t meet the budgetary approval threshold. Ben’s case had been greenlit. I felt the weight of delivering this news directly to Alex, knowing how capable and dedicated he was. I scheduled a private one-on-one meeting, and I approached it with care. My opening words were direct but gentle: &quot;Alex, thanks for taking the time to discuss your promotion readiness. Following our conversation about potential budget constraints, there&#x27;s been a final decision on the Director role.&quot; I then clearly explained that the rejection was due to overall budget limitations impacting this specific year, not because of Alex’s performance, skills, or lack of impact. I immediately followed up by reaffirming his immense value, &quot;Your work here has been critical. You&#x27;ve consistently delivered exceptional results and shown strong leadership on our team. Your promotion wasn&#x27;t denied based on anything other than these external financial factors.&quot; This was essential to ensure he understood the decision&#x27;s basis.</p><p>Alex was disappointed but also understood the situation and was gracious in his response. He was appreciative of all the time I had spent with him and understood that we had tried our best this round, and we would try again in the next promotion cycle. To acknowledge his contributions meaningfully, I went beyond just explaining the &#x27;why&#x27;. I secured an alternative form of recognition, a greater than average raise for that year, compensating him monetarily even though it wasn&#x27;t a formal promotion. Additionally, I laid out a concrete plan to revisit the promotion case in six months, contingent on demonstrating further impact and aligning more closely with specific budget goals at that time. Lastly, I offered him space to process: &quot;This is news that needs some reflection. Take today if you need to think it through.&quot; He needed time to absorb it all and took the rest of the day off.</p><svg height="350" width="350" class="__2025-08-05-Giving-Difficult-Feedback_svg__pw1zO"><circle cx="100" cy="100" r="95" stroke="#20C2DF" stroke-width="3" fill="#20C2DF" fill-opacity="0.3"></circle><circle cx="250" cy="100" r="95" stroke="#DF20C2" stroke-width="3" fill="#DF20C2" fill-opacity="0.3"></circle><circle cx="175" cy="225" r="95" stroke="#C2DF20" stroke-width="3" fill="#C2DF20" fill-opacity="0.3"></circle><text x="100" y="100" text-anchor="middle" stroke="#0B424D" stroke-width="1px" alignment-baseline="middle">Honesty</text><text x="250" y="100" text-anchor="middle" stroke="#4D0B42" stroke-width="1px"> Integrity</text><text x="175" y="235" text-anchor="middle" stroke="#424D0B" stroke-width="1px"> Transparency</text></svg><p>The result was profoundly positive. Alex reacted with remarkable professionalism, immediately extending his heartfelt congratulations to Ben for the promotion and expressing full understanding of why he hadn&#x27;t been selected due to budgetary reasons. He appreciated my upfront communication about the financial context and felt genuinely supported by having advocated for him internally, even if success wasn&#x27;t possible this cycle. He also mentioned that the higher raise helped ease the blow of losing out on the promotion. Crucially, despite the setback, Alex&#x27;s motivation remained intact. He didn&#x27;t retreat. Instead, he stayed engaged and proactive. I noticed his willingness to step into temporary leadership gaps in projects previously managed solely by Ben or take on additional cross-functional responsibilities that yearned for more visibility.</p><p>This experience was a powerful lesson. It solidified my approach to talent management, that anticipating constraints isn&#x27;t just about preparation. It&#x27;s about leading with transparency, even when delivering uncomfortable truths. Early expectation setting and coaching significantly mitigated potential damage. Recognizing high performers not only monetarily but also by investing in their future prospects, via monthly career coaching sessions, is vital for maintaining morale and trust. Delivering difficult feedback effectively doesn&#x27;t break a person. It can strengthen commitment if handled with empathy, clarity, and a forward-looking perspective.</p><div class="__2025-08-05-Giving-Difficult-Feedback_thoughtExperiment__e0jNA"><h2 class="thought-experiment-title">Thought Experiment</h2><p>How would you have handled the situation if the feedback from Alex wasn’t positive?
