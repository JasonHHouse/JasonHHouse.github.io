They&#x27;ve challenged my thinking, provided frameworks for difficult situations, and offered perspectives from leaders who&#x27;ve navigated similar challenges. The books on this list aren&#x27;t just theoretical—they&#x27;re practical guides that have directly influenced how I approach team development, difficult conversations, and organizational change.</p><p>I&#x27;ve organized this reading list into categories that align with different aspects of leadership development. Whether you&#x27;re a new manager or a seasoned executive, these books offer insights that can transform how you lead and develop others. Each recommendation comes with why it made the list and how it&#x27;s shaped my leadership approach.</p><h2 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_categoryHeader__OXCoF">Core Leadership Foundations</h2><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by Patrick Lencioni</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">This book revolutionized how I think about team dynamics. Lencioni&#x27;s pyramid—trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and results—provides a clear framework for diagnosing and addressing team issues. I&#x27;ve used these concepts to transform struggling teams into high-performing units.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Trust is the foundation of everything. Without psychological safety, teams can&#x27;t engage in productive conflict, make real commitments, or hold each other accountable.</p></div><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">First, Break All the Rules</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">Based on Gallup&#x27;s extensive research, this book challenged many of my assumptions about management. It taught me to focus on people&#x27;s strengths rather than trying to fix their weaknesses, and showed me how to create environments where people can do their best work.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Great managers discover what is unique about each person and capitalize on it. Don&#x27;t waste time trying to put in what was left out—try to draw out what was left in.</p></div><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">The Culture Code</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by Daniel Coyle</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">Coyle&#x27;s research into high-performing cultures provided me with actionable insights into creating psychological safety, building trust, and establishing clear purpose. The three skills—building safety, sharing vulnerability, and establishing purpose—became central to my team-building approach.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Great cultures are built through small actions repeated consistently. The most powerful signal leaders can send is vulnerability—it creates safety for others to take risks and grow.</p></div><h2 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_categoryHeader__OXCoF">Coaching and Development</h2><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">The Coaching Habit</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by Michael Bungay Stanier</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">This practical guide transformed how I approach one-on-ones and development conversations. The seven essential questions helped me shift from advice-giving to curiosity-driven coaching, enabling my team members to find their own solutions and grow their problem-solving capabilities.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Ask more, tell less. The question &quot;What&#x27;s the real challenge here for you?&quot; alone has unlocked countless productive conversations and insights.</p></div><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">Crucial Conversations</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">When stakes are high and emotions run strong, this book provides the framework for navigating difficult conversations with grace and effectiveness. I&#x27;ve used these techniques for performance discussions, conflict resolution, and organizational change communications.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Start with heart—clarify what you really want and what you want for others. Create safety so dialogue can flow freely, even when discussing sensitive topics.</p></div><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">Radical Candor</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by Kim Scott</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">Scott&#x27;s framework for caring personally while challenging directly has been instrumental in how I approach feedback and performance management. It taught me how to give honest, helpful feedback while maintaining strong relationships with my team.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The sweet spot between caring personally and challenging directly creates the best outcomes for both individuals and teams. Avoiding difficult conversations helps no one.</p></div><h2 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_categoryHeader__OXCoF">Organizational Excellence</h2><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">Good to Great</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by Jim Collins</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">Collins&#x27; research into what separates good companies from great ones provided timeless insights into leadership effectiveness. The concepts of Level 5 Leadership, getting the right people on the bus, and the Hedgehog Concept have guided many of my strategic decisions.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Level 5 leaders channel their ego needs away from themselves and into the larger goal of building a great company. It&#x27;s not about being the hero—it&#x27;s about building something that lasts.</p></div><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">Multipliers</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by Liz Wiseman</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">Wiseman&#x27;s research on how leaders either amplify or diminish the intelligence of their teams was eye-opening. This book helped me identify and eliminate &quot;diminisher&quot; behaviors while cultivating &quot;multiplier&quot; practices that bring out the best in others.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The best leaders don&#x27;t create followers—they create other leaders. Ask yourself: Am I getting the best thinking from my team, or am I the smartest person in the room too often?</p></div><h2 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_categoryHeader__OXCoF">Personal Effectiveness</h2><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">Atomic Habits</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by James Clear</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">Clear&#x27;s systematic approach to habit formation has been invaluable for both personal development and team transformation. The framework of making good habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying has helped me design systems that support sustained behavioral change.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> You don&#x27;t rise to the level of your goals; you fall to the level of your systems. Focus on designing processes that make success inevitable rather than relying on motivation.</p></div><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">Mindset</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by Carol Dweck</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">Dweck&#x27;s research on fixed versus growth mindset fundamentally changed how I approach challenges, feedback, and team development. Understanding that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work has shaped how I coach others through difficult periods.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The power of &quot;yet&quot;—when someone says &quot;I can&#x27;t do this,&quot; add &quot;yet&quot; to the end. It opens possibilities for growth and learning that a fixed mindset closes off.</p></div><h2 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_categoryHeader__OXCoF">Leading Through Change</h2><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">Leading Change</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by John Kotter</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">Kotter&#x27;s eight-step process for leading organizational change has been my go-to framework for navigating complex transformations. From creating urgency to anchoring new approaches in culture, this book provides a roadmap for sustainable change.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Change fails most often because leaders skip steps or don&#x27;t invest enough time in each phase. Creating a sense of urgency and building a guiding coalition are critical foundations.</p></div><div class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookCard__tTCpY"><h3 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_bookTitle__lQ27Y">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</h3><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_author__TGJEK">by Ben Horowitz</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_description__qWkdv">Horowitz&#x27;s brutally honest account of the challenges of leadership resonated deeply with my own experiences. This book doesn&#x27;t sugarcoat the difficult decisions leaders must make and provides practical guidance for navigating the toughest situations.</p><p class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_keyTakeaway__BtuvO"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> There&#x27;s no recipe for dealing with the hard things. The key is to face them head-on, make decisions with incomplete information, and learn from the outcomes.</p></div><h2 class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_categoryHeader__OXCoF">Building Your Reading Practice</h2><p>Reading is just the beginning—the real value comes from application. Here&#x27;s how I approach leadership reading:</p><ul class="__2025-09-28-Reading-List_practiceList__mE5vI"><li><strong>Take notes actively:</strong> I keep a leadership journal where I capture key insights and reflect on how they apply to current challenges.</li><li><strong>Experiment immediately:</strong> Try one new concept from each book within a week of reading it. Small experiments lead to big insights.</li><li><strong>Share with your team:</strong> Discussing books with colleagues creates shared language and accelerates learning for everyone.</li><li><strong>Revisit favorites:</strong> Great leadership books reveal new insights at different stages of your journey. Don&#x27;t be afraid to reread.</li><li><strong>Connect the dots:</strong> Look for patterns across different authors and approaches. The best insights often come from synthesizing multiple perspectives.</li></ul><p>Leadership development is a continuous journey, and these books have been trusted guides along the way. They&#x27;ve helped me navigate challenges, develop others, and build stronger teams. Most importantly, they&#x27;ve reminded me that great leadership is learnable—it&#x27;s a set of skills and mindsets that can be developed through intention, practice, and reflection.</p><p>What books have shaped your leadership approach? I&#x27;m always looking for new perspectives and would love to hear your recommendations.</p></div><div class="sidebar"><br/><div><strong>Tags:</strong> <span>#<!-- -->leadership<!-- --> </span><span>#<!-- -->development<!-- --> </span><span>#<!-- -->resources<!-- --> </span></div></div></div><div class="container"><footer class="Footer_footer__8nXNy">© 2025 Jason House&#x27;s Blog.
