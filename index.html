  <h1>Leadership and Mentorship</h1>

  <p>Leadership is commonly said to be something you're born with. Although, you may have some personality traits that
    align well, it's been my experience that leadership is an individualized, ever evolving journey. Learning the right
    techniques, building the right processes, and executing with experiences are critical.</p>

  <p>Mentorship is tightly coupled with leadership. To be the best leader, you have to understand and practice strong
    mentorship.</p>

  <p>People are excellent at reading BS. Transparency, honesty, and integrity are critical to your leadershp journey.
  </p>

  <p>I am sharing my journey in leadership and mentorship to grow even more people.</p>

  <p>Why am I a good leader? I've led teams at work, in sports, in BSA, and more. I enjoy the complexity of
    people and seeing them achive their goals.</p>
