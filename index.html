    <p>Leadership is commonly said to be something you're born with. Although, you may have some personality traits that
      align well, it's been my experience that leadership is an individualized, ever evolving journey. Learning the
      right
      techniques, building the right processes, and executing with experiences are critical.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mentorship is tightly coupled with leadership. To be the best leader, you have to understand and practice strong
      mentorship.</p>
    <br>
    <p>People are excellent at reading BS. Transparency, honesty, and integrity are critical to your leadershp journey.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I am sharing my journey in leadership and mentorship to grow even more people.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Why am I a good leader? I've led teams at work, in sports, in BSA, and more. I enjoy the complexity of
      people and seeing them achive their goals.</p>

        <h2>Senior Software Engineering Manager</h2>
        <p>Jason had been my manager and mentor for the past 2 years at Indeed. I have become
          a better manager and
          leader with his guidance. Jason showed me his management framework and processes on how to lead my teams
          effectively.</p>
        <p>One of Jason&#39;s assets is his ability to listen attentively and offer
          well-thought-out, timely,
          relevant
          advices to help me solve my problems. I also appreciated his candor when it comes to offering feedback and
          situational assessments (as in he wouldn&#39;t hesitate to tell me that we were in deep s***t).</p>
        <p>I wouldn&#39;t be where I am today with Jason&#39;s mentorship.</p>

        <h2>Software Engineering Manager</h2>
        <p>Jason is an exceptional leader I&#39;ve had the privilege to work with. As a manager and mentor, he genuinely
          cares about
          his people. He consistently makes me feel supported, valued, and empowered to do my best work.</p>

        <p>Jason keeps the big picture in focus while always staying grounded in the needs of his team. He leads with
          empathy,
          never micromanages, and creates an environment where others can thrive.</p>

        <p>He&#39;s also an incredible resource for continuous learning. He genourously recommended books and that
          became the most
          impactful resources in my professional development. He has a talent for distilling complex ideas into
          actionable
          insights and always seems to have just the right recommendation at the right time.</p>

        <p>Anyone looking for a coach/leader who&#39;s wise, genuine, and invested in people&#39;s success would be
          lucky to work with
          Jason. Jason will challenge you to grow, support you through it, and leave you a better leader than you were
          before.</p>
